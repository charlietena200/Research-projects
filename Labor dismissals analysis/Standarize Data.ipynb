Esta distinci\\u00f3n es crucial para saber qu\\u00e9 derechos puedes reclamar en cada caso.\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udccb Puntos Clave\\n\\n### Despido Justificado\\nUn despido es considerado **justificado** cuando el patr\\u00f3n tiene una raz\\u00f3n v\\u00e1lida, reconocida por la ley, para terminar la relaci\\u00f3n laboral. Algunas de estas razones mencionadas en la Ley Federal del Trabajo son:\\n  \\n1. **Faltas de Probidad o Honradez**\\n   - Ejemplo: Robar algo de la empresa.\\n\\n2. **Actos de Violencia**\\n   - Ejemplo: Participar en peleas dentro del lugar de trabajo.\\n\\n3. **Incumplimiento de Normas**\\n   - Ejemplo: Repetidamente no seguir \\u00f3rdenes leg\\u00edtimas dentro del trabajo.\\n\\nPara que este tipo de despido sea v\\u00e1lido, el patr\\u00f3n debe avisarte antes y comprobar las causas.\\n\\n### Despido Injustificado\\nUn despido se considera **injustificado** cuando no se cumplen las razones legales del art\\u00edculo 47 o no se te avis\\u00f3 correctamente. En estos casos:\\n\\n- Tienes derecho a reclamar el pago por d\\u00edas trabajados, la parte de tus prestaciones como aguinaldo y vacaciones, adem\\u00e1s de una indemnizaci\\u00f3n especial que incluye tres meses de sueldo y un pago por antig\\u00fcedad (de 12 d\\u00edas por a\\u00f1o trabajado).\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\ude80 Consejos Adicionales\\n\\n- **Revisa tu Aviso de Despido**: Aseg\\u00farate de que tiene razones v\\u00e1lidas.\\n- **Consulta tus Derechos**: Si crees que tu despido fue injustificado, podr\\u00edas negociar o demandar.\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udccc Resumen\\n\\nEntender las razones de tu despido ayuda a saber qu\\u00e9 derechos puedes hacer valer.

Las actas administrativas son documentos que las empresas usan para dejar constancia de alg\\u00fan comportamiento o situaci\\u00f3n relacionada con la persona trabajadora.\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udccb Puntos Clave sobre las Actas Administrativas\\n\\n1. **Prop\\u00f3sito del Acta Administrativa**\\n   - Sirven para documentar incidentes como retrasos, faltas o incumplimientos de normas.\\n   - Buscan formalizar registros internos en caso de que sea necesario verificar comportamientos repetidos.\\n\\n2. **Validez del Acta**\\n   - Por s\\u00ed solas, no suelen ser suficientes para justificar un despido. Deben ser claras, precisas, y la persona trabajadora tiene el derecho de conocer el contenido y firmarla.\\n   - Si no est\\u00e1s de acuerdo con lo que dice el acta, tienes la opci\\u00f3n de agregar tus comentarios u objeciones al final del documento.\\n\\n3. **Uso en Despidos**\\n   - En un procedimiento legal, las actas pueden ser consideradas como evidencia de un historial de conductas, pero no sustituyen las causas legales requeridas para un despido justificado.\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udca1 Recomendaciones\\n\\n- **Lee Antes de Firmar**: Siempre revisa el contenido del acta; tienes el derecho de saber exactamente qu\\u00e9 se documento.\\n- **Responde Formalmente**: Si no est\\u00e1s de acuerdo, indica tus razones de desacuerdo en el acta o por escrito.\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udccc Conclusi\\u00f3n\\n\\nLas actas administrativas son herramientas internas v\\u00e1lidas para la documentaci\\u00f3n laboral, pero no son definitivas para un despido justificado.

Saber distinguir entre un despido justificado y uno injustificado es esencial para entender tus derechos como trabajador.\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udccb Puntos Clave\\n\\n1. **Despido Justificado**\\n   - Se da cuando el patr\\u00f3n tiene una raz\\u00f3n v\\u00e1lida, seg\\u00fan el art\\u00edculo 47 de la Ley Federal del Trabajo.\\n   - Ejemplos comunes incluyen:\\n     - *Falta de probidad u honradez*: Como robar en el lugar de trabajo.\\n     - *Violencia o malos tratos*: Abusar verbal o f\\u00edsicamente de compa\\u00f1eros o supervisores.\\n     - *Inasistencias frecuentes*: No presentarse a trabajar sin justificarlo repetidamente.\\n   - En estos casos, el patr\\u00f3n debe darte un aviso por escrito mencionando la raz\\u00f3n del despido.\\n\\n2. **Despido Injustificado**\\n   - Sucede cuando no hay una raz\\u00f3n legalmente v\\u00e1lida para tu despido, o no se te ha entregado el aviso por escrito.\\n   - Aqu\\u00ed tienes derecho a reclamar ciertas prestaciones, como los **tres meses de sueldo** y la *prima de antig\\u00fcedad*.\\n\\n## \\ud83c\\udfe2 Consecuencias y Recomendaciones\\n- En caso de un despido injustificado, puedes buscar la **conciliaci\\u00f3n** en el Centro de Conciliaci\\u00f3n Laboral para resolver el conflicto y obtener tus prestaciones de manera m\\u00e1s r\\u00e1pida y efectiva.\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udccc Resumen \\n\\nJonathan, un despido justificado se basa en razones claras y espec\\u00edficas definidas por la ley; si no se cumple con esos requisitos, se considera injustificado y puedes reclamar compensaciones significativas.

Vamos a explicarlo de manera sencilla:\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udccb Puntos Clave\\n\\n1. **Definici\\u00f3n B\\u00e1sica**\\n   - Los d\\u00edas ca\\u00eddos se refieren a los salarios que se acumulan desde el d\\u00eda del despido hasta el momento en que se resuelve el conflicto laboral, ya sea por un acuerdo o una sentencia.\\n\\n2. **Contexto en el Proceso Legal**\\n   - Este concepto cobra relevancia principalmente en juicios laborales por despido injustificado. Si el resultado del juicio es a favor del trabajador, se le debe pagar el salario correspondiente a estos d\\u00edas.\\n\\n3. **Importancia**\\n   - Es un incentivo para que los empleadores resuelvan los conflictos r\\u00e1pidamente, ya que mientras no haya resoluci\\u00f3n, el salario sigue acumul\\u00e1ndose.\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udcdd Ejemplo Pr\\u00e1ctico\\n\\nImagina que te despiden y decides ir a juicio, que dura, por ejemplo, un a\\u00f1o. Si al final ganas el juicio, adem\\u00e1s de otras compensaciones, la empresa te debe pagar el salario que habr\\u00edas recibido durante esos doce meses.\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\ude80 Consejos Adicionales\\n\\n- *Conciliaci\\u00f3n Previa*: Considera primero solucionar el problema mediante la conciliaci\\u00f3n, que es m\\u00e1s r\\u00e1pida y donde no se generan d\\u00edas ca\\u00eddos porque se busca un convenio inmediato.\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udccc Resumen\\n\\nLos d\\u00edas ca\\u00eddos son una forma de proteger al trabajador cuando el juicio se prolonga mucho tiempo. Aunque es una medida que act\\u00faa como compensaci\\u00f3n, lo ideal es que los conflictos se resuelvan antes para evitar juicios largos.

Según la **Ley Federal del Trabajo** (LFT) en el artículo 518, tienes un plazo de **dos meses** desde el día siguiente en que te separaron de tu trabajo para exigir tus derechos.\\n\\n## 🗓️ Detalles Importantes\\n\\n- **Inicio del Plazo**: El conteo comienza al día siguiente del despido. Por ejemplo, si te despidieron el 1 de enero, tienes hasta el 2 de marzo.\\n- **Meses Calendario**: Es importante tener en cuenta que estos dos meses se consideran como meses calendario, no se cuentan como 60 días.\\n- **Pausa del Plazo**: Si presentas una solicitud de conciliación, este plazo se \"pausa\" mientras dura el procedimiento de conciliación prejudicial.\\n\\n## 📋 Ejemplo de Pausa en el Plazo\\n\\n| Fecha | Evento | Días transcurridos del plazo |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 de agosto | Fecha de despido | Día  (cero) |\\n| 15 de agosto | Presentas solicitud de conciliación | Día 14 |\\n| 15 al 30 de agosto | Procedimiento de conciliación  (se PAUSA el conteo) | Pausado (no corren días) |\\n| 30 de agosto | Te entregan constancia de no conciliación | Se reanuda el conteo |\\n| **Hasta el 15 de octubre** | Fecha límite para presentar demanda | Día 60 |\\n\\n🚀 **Sugerencia**: Una buena estrategia es acudir al **Centro de Conciliación Laboral** lo más pronto posible para iniciar el procedimiento de conciliación, ya que esto te dará más tiempo para decidir si deseas presentar una demanda formal en caso de no llegar a un acuerdo.\\n\\n### Mensaje de la Persona\\n\\n¿Me recomiendas llevar un abogado a la audiencia de conciliación?\\n\\n### Respuesta del Asistente\\n\\n🔍 **Decidir si llevar un abogado a la audiencia de conciliación**\\n\\nDecidir si llevar un abogado a la audiencia de conciliación requiere considerar bien tus opciones. Aquí algunos puntos clave:\\n\\n## 🎯 Información Importante\\n\\n1. **No es obligatorio un abogado**:\\n   - La **Ley Federal del Trabajo** no exige que vayas con un abogado. Puedes ir con una persona de confianza como un amigo o familiar.\\n   - Las personas conciliadoras se asegurarán de que tus derechos no se vean afectados durante el procedimiento.\\n\\n2. **Ventajas y desventajas**:\\n   - **Ventajas**: Un abogado puede ayudarte a entender mejor tus derechos y calcular lo que realmente te deben.\\n   - **Desventajas**: Algunos abogados pueden sugerir alargar el conflicto para ir a juicio, lo que puede ser más costoso y demorar más tiempo. Los abogados suelen cobrar aproximadamente el 30% de cualquier acuerdo al que llegues.\\n\\n3. **Decisión personal**:\\n   - La decisión es completamente tuya. Ir solo o con un abogado no debería influir en la efectividad de llegar a un acuerdo justo.\\n\\n## 🚀 Recomendación Personal\\n\\n✨ **Prueba primero la conciliación**: Puedes comenzar sin un abogado y llevar a alguien de confianza. Si luego decides que necesitas asesoría legal, podrías contactar a la **Procuraduría de la Defensa del Trabajo** para asistencia gratuita.\\n\\n¡Espero que esta información te ayude a tomar la mejor decisión! ¿Te gustaría saber más sobre cómo es la audiencia de conciliación?\\n\\n### Mensaje de la Persona\\n\\n¿Qué sucede si no se llega a un acuerdo en la audiencia de conciliación?\\n\\n### Respuesta del Asistente\\n\\n🔄 **Cuando no se llega a un acuerdo en la audiencia de conciliación**\\n\\nA veces, a pesar de los esfuerzos, no se logra un acuerdo en la audiencia de conciliación. Aquí te explico qué sucede en esos casos:\\n\\n## 📋 Pasos Posteriores\\n\\n1. **Constancia de No Conciliación (CNC)**:\\n   - El Centro de Conciliación Laboral te entregará una **Constancia de No Conciliación**.\\n   - Este documento es importante porque te permite estar listo para presentar una demanda en los tribunales laborales si decides seguir adelante.\\n\\n2. **Reanudar el plazo para demandar**:\\n   - La emisión de la CNC hace que el conteo de los dos meses para exigir tus derechos continúe desde donde se pausó durante la conciliación.\\n   - Asegúrate de revisar cuántos días te quedan para demandar si esa es tu elección.\\n\\n3. **Considerar tus opciones**:\\n   - Con la CNC en mano, puedes decidir entre intentar otras negociaciones o presentar formalmente una demanda ante un tribunal laboral.\\n\\n## 💡 Sugerencias\\n\\n- **Analiza tus opciones**: A veces, las emociones pueden afectar las decisiones.

Aquí te explico cómo es y qué esperar:\\n\\n## 🗓️ Estructura de la Audiencia\\n\\n1. **Revisión de Identificaciones**:\\n   - El conciliador comienza verificando las identificaciones de las personas presentes y, si es necesario, las autorizaciones de quienes representan al empleador.\\n\\n2. **Presentación del Punto de Vista del Trabajador**:\\n   - Como persona trabajadora, tendrás la oportunidad de contar tu versión de los hechos. Explica qué ocurrió y qué esperas obtener de la conciliación, como un acuerdo económico.\\n\\n3. **Respuesta del Empleador**:\\n   - El empleador o su representante expondrá su punto de vista y podrá hacer una contrapropuesta.\\n\\n4. **Intervención del Conciliador**:\\n   - El conciliador facilita la conversación, asegurando que sea imparcial, y puede sugerir posibles soluciones al conflicto.\\n\\n5. **Conclusión de la Audiencia**:\\n   - Tres posibles resultados:\\n     - Llegar a un acuerdo y firmar un convenio.\\n     - No alcanzar un acuerdo y emitir una **Constancia de No Conciliación**.\\n     - Programar una nueva audiencia para continuar las negociaciones.\\n\\n## 💡 Consejos para la Audiencia\\n\\n- Sé claro y honesto sobre tus expectativas y escúchalas del empleador.\\n- Mantén una comunicación respetuosa y enfocada en resolver el conflicto.\\n- No necesitas llevar documentación, pero si tienes contratos o recibos, pueden ayudarte a sentirte más seguro.\\n\\n📝 Espero que esta guía te ayude a entender cómo se desarrollará tu audiencia.

Esta herramienta te permite ingresar tus datos y te ayuda a tener una estimación de lo que podría tocarte.\\n\\n## 🚀 Sugerencias Adicionales\\n\\n- **Documentar todo**: Reúne todos tus documentos como recibos de pago o contratos, lo que habrá muy útil en la conciliación para mostrar pruebas.\\n- **Buscar asesoría**: Considera acudir al Centro de Conciliación Laboral para recibir orientación sobre tus derechos y el proceso.\\n\\nSi necesitas más información sobre cómo calcular, no dudes en preguntarme, ¡estoy aquí para apoyarte! 😊\\n\\n### Mensaje de la Persona\\n\\nEs mi jefe directo con quien concilio la demanda\\n\\n### Respuesta del Asistente\\n\\n🔍 **¿Con quién se lleva la conciliación en caso de una demanda?**\\n\\nEn el proceso de conciliación, no necesariamente tendrás que negociar directamente con tu jefe inmediato. Aquí te explico cómo funciona:\\n\\n## 🗣️ ¿Con quién se lleva a cabo la conciliación?\\n\\n1. **Representante de la Empresa**:\\n   - La persona que te enfrentas en la audiencia de conciliación no tiene que ser tu jefe directo. Normalmente, la empresa envía a un representante, que podría ser alguien del departamento de recursos humanos o un abogado.\\n   - Esta persona tendrá la autorización necesaria para negociar y tomar decisiones en nombre de la empresa.\\n\\n2. **Facilitador del Proceso**:\\n   - La audiencia es dirigida por una persona conciliadora del Centro de Conciliación Laboral. Su papel es actuar de manera imparcial y ayudarte a ti y al representante de la empresa a llegar a un acuerdo.\\n\\n## 🔍 Qué esperar en la conciliación:\\n\\n- **Diálogo Abierto**: Hablarás sobre tu situación laboral y tus expectativas. El representante de la empresa hará lo mismo.\\n- **Guía del Conciliador**: Proponer soluciones y guiar la discusión para que sea constructiva y respetuosa.\\n- **Potenciales Resultados**: Podrías llegar a un acuerdo, decidir no continuar con la conciliación o planear una reunión futura para más negociaciones.\\n\\n⚖️ **Sugerencia**: Mantén el enfoque en tus prioridades y derechos, y mantén siempre un trato respetuoso con todas las personas involucradas para facilitar un acuerdo beneficioso.

Por ejemplo:\\n     - Si la persona trabajadora comete actos deshonestos.\\n     - Si hay faltas de probidad o mal comportamiento.\\n     - Si hay faltas repetidas de asistencia sin una justificaci\\u00f3n razonable.\\n   - El empleador debe informar a la persona trabajadora sobre las razones del despido. \\n\\n2. **Despido Injustificado**\\n   - Si ninguna de las causas legales se cumple, el despido es injustificado.\\n   - El empleador no da o no puede probar el motivo del despido.\\n   - En este caso, la persona trabajadora tiene derecho a reclamar compensaciones, como los tres meses de sueldo y un pago por antig\\u00fcedad.\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\ude80 Beneficios de la Conciliaci\\u00f3n\\n\\nElegir la conciliaci\\u00f3n puede permitir resolver el conflicto r\\u00e1pidamente y de forma amistosa, ahorrando tiempo y gastos que un juicio implicar\\u00eda. Las personas trabajadoras no renuncian a sus derechos al buscar un acuerdo.\\n\\n## \\ud83d\\udccc Resumen y Pr\\u00f3ximos Pasos\\n\\nEntender las razones del despido es crucial para proteger tus derechos. Si el despido fue injustificado, puedes buscar el procedimiento de conciliaci\\u00f3n para resolver el problema r\\u00e1pidamente. Siempre es recomendable revisar si el despido est\\u00e1 bien fundamentado para tomar las mejores acciones.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":30}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df[df[\"id\"] == 1023].conversacion.iloc[0]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":105},"id":"gyaCDdvJsoXo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764270821063,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":48,"user":{"displayName":"Well_Tec","userId":"02401627104003448978"}},"outputId":"9c9b4d1f-684c-4a61-d3dd-05357969310d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'### Mensaje de la Persona\\n\\n¿Cuál es la diferencia entre un despido justificado y uno injustificado?\\n\\n### Respuesta del Asistente\\n\\n🎯 **Descifrando el Despido: Justificado vs Injustificado**\\n\\nCuando una persona trabajadora enfrenta un despido, es crucial entender si este se considera justificado o injustificado, ya que eso afecta lo que puede reclamar. Vamos a verlo de manera sencilla:\\n\\n## 📋 Puntos Clave\\n\\n1. **Despido Justificado**\\n   - Un despido es considerado justificado cuando ocurre por alguna de las razones que se mencionan en el artículo 47 de la Ley Federal del Trabajo. Algunos ejemplos son:\\n     - *Robar o dañar deliberadamente propiedad de la empresa.*\\n     - *No acatar órdenes sin un motivo válido.*\\n     - *Faltar al trabajo injustificadamente seguido.*\\n   - En estos casos, la empresa debe informar al trabajador sobre las razones del despido.\\n\\n2. **Despido Injustificado**\\n   - Si el empleador no puede demostrar que se cumplieron estas razones o no avisa al trabajador de las causas, se presume que el despido es injustificado.\\n   - En esta situación, el trabajador puede reclamar ciertas prestaciones adicionales como compensaciones económicas.\\n\\n## 🚀 Beneficios de la Conciliación\\n\\nAhí es donde la conciliación puede ser muy útil. Permite que ambas partes dialoguen y lleguen a un acuerdo sin necesidad de ir a juicio, logrando una solución más rápida y menos costosa.\\n\\nLa conciliación ofrece un camino amigable para resolver discrepancias. Es gratis, rápida y evita estrés innecesario. Si no se llega a un acuerdo, la constancia de no conciliación les permite a los trabajadores proceder jurídicamente.\\n\\n¿Maria de Lourdes, hay algo más específico que te gustaría saber sobre este
